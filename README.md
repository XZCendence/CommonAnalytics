# CommonAnalytics
Unreal Engine plugin with basic analytics and metrics bundled with a basic API server
## Overview
CommonAnalytics is an Unreal Engine plugin with extensible API client logic designed to get you in-flight very quickly with basic metrics and analytics that you manage. 
In this repository is the plugin source itself, along with a basic API server written in Go with the gin-gonic framework.
## Usage
I am only distributing the source code of the plugin at this time, I plan to release binaries later once the codebase has matured a bit. The plugin can currently be installed by dropping the it into your project's or engine's Plugins folder and compiling.
